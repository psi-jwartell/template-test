# template-test
This is a template repository that can be used for ATMegaS64M1 projects.
The idea is that you create a new repository based on this template, 
and then modify the items in the `eo_module` folder along with the `CMakeLists.txt`.
Everything else should be able to stay the same. 
This means that the shared common code does not change per-submodule for PSNDL-L.
